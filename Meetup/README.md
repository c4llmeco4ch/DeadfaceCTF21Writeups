## Prompt

A member of DEADFACE suggested that they all meet up at some point. With this information, we'd be able to contact law enforcement to get them all at once! What does the picture say about their meetup location, though?

Submit the flag as: `flag{location}`.

Example: `flag{Golden Gate Bridge}`.

## Solution

Any means of reverse image search will do for this task. The simplest method is going to `Google -> Images -> Search by Image` and pasting the URL for the image in the appropriate box. The image search should return results detailing how this is a picture from the Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, PA. Thus, formatting the flag correctly leads us to the answer: `flag{Eastern State Penitentiary}`
